##Assignment 2, Yelp
![alt tag]()

**Hours taken: 6-7**
**Milestones Completed**
[done] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
[done] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
[implemented but couldn't figure out connections] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

[done] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
[done] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
[done] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states. Optional: implement a custom switch

**Milestones Not Completed**
[partial] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings
 - this works for restaurant options, but did not have time to fully connect the other filter options
